# FocusFlow

**FocusFlow** is a smart study planning assistant that helps users create effective study plans using AI. Just input a topic, and FocusFlow will generate a personalized study plan, determine the required time and resources (optionally using Gemini API), and automatically schedule events on your Google Calendar with email reminders. You can provide feedback on your progress, and the system adapts accordingly to help you strengthen weaker areas.
